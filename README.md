# Hexapod Locomotion Framework (ESP32)

| Supported Targets | ESP32 |
| ----------------- | ----- |

</div>

## 1. Project Overview
This repository contains firmware for a fully custom 6‑leg (hexapod) walking robot built around an ESP32 using the ESP‑IDF framework. The code implements a modular locomotion stack: user command capture → gait phase scheduling → swing trajectory generation → whole body inverse kinematics → KPP motion limiting/state estimation → servo actuation. All mechanical parts are custom designed and 3D printed.

Facts:
- Architecture design inspired by [Efficient gait generation and evaluation for hexapod robots (2024)](https://cjme.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s10033-024-01000-0)
- I burned three ESP32 dev boards during development and counting
- Project eaten up 2 months of my life up to the first release and working stage

Documentation:
- Consolidated technical docs live in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md).

## 2. Hardware Summary
* MCU / Control: ESP32 module (classic dual‑core variant) running FreeRTOS via ESP‑IDF
* Servos: 18 × high‑torque 35 kg.cm hobby servos (3 DOF per leg: coxa yaw, femur pitch, tibia)
* Power Architecture:
  * Main source: 4S LiPo battery
  * Each pair of legs (i.e. 6 servos) is powered by its own dedicated 20A UBEC (3 UBECs total for locomotion load distribution)
  * Logic / ESP32 / auxiliary electronics powered by a separate UBEC for isolation and brown‑out resilience
* Signal Driving:
  * Mixed use of MCPWM and LEDC peripherals to reach 18 PWM outputs on classic ESP32
  * Dynamic allocation strategy reuses MCPWM operators/generators and assigns some legs to LEDC channels
* Mechanical Structure: All joints, brackets, and chassis components are custom 3D printed (CAD‑designed) around standardized servo sizes and link lengths.

## 3. Mechanical & Kinematic Model
Each leg provides 3 degrees of freedom:
1. Coxa (yaw / horizontal rotation, establishing lateral reach)
2. Femur (pitch / vertical-plane lift)
3. Tibia (distal pitch / extension)

Nominal link lengths (meters) from `robot_config.c`:
* Coxa: 0.068 m
* Femur: 0.088 m
* Tibia: 0.127 m

Coordinate Frames:
* Body frame: X forward (+), Y left (+), Z up (+)
* Leg-local frame: X outward (+), Y forward (+), Z up (+) for planning; internally the IK expects Z downward in some comments but is reconciled via transforms in `components/hex_locomotion/whole_body_control.c`.

Mount poses (per leg) define (x, y, z, yaw) to rotate body-frame targets into leg-local coordinates. Yaw is ±90° plus minor angular offsets to create a symmetric stance.

High-level data flow (single control task loop at 100 Hz / 10 ms):

1. `user_command_poll()` (in `components/hex_locomotion/user_command.c`)
	* Reads latest decoded RC controller state (`components/hex_controller_core/controller.c`) over FlySky iBUS via UART.
	* Produces normalized user command structure (`user_command_t`). Includes gait selection, enable flag, velocity command, body height, lateral offset, terrain mode, step scaling.
2. `gait_scheduler_update()` (in `components/hex_locomotion/gait_scheduler.c`)
	* Maintains a continuous phase 0..1 and per‑leg support vs swing state based on selected gait (Tripod, Ripple, Wave) and commanded speed.
3. `swing_trajectory_generate()` (in `components/hex_locomotion/swing_trajectory.c`)
	* Converts gait phase + user motion/pose targets into desired foot positions in the body frame.
	* Uses cycloid‑like arcs for swing, linear pass for support, adjustable step length and clearance.
4. `whole_body_control_compute()` (in `components/hex_locomotion/whole_body_control.c`)
	* Transforms each foot target from body frame into its corresponding leg-local frame using mount pose and yaw.
	* Solves per‑leg inverse kinematics (`leg_ik_solve()` from `components/hex_kinematics/leg.c`) to produce joint angles.
5. `kpp_apply_limits()` (in `components/hex_motion_limits/kpp_system.c`)
	* Applies jerk/acceleration/velocity limiting to desired joint commands.
6. `robot_execute()` (in `components/hex_actuation/robot_control.c`)
	* Maps joint angles (radians) into microsecond PWM pulses with calibration (limits, inversion, offsets) from `components/hex_robot_config/robot_config.c`.
	* Lazily initializes MCPWM / LEDC channels and updates compare or duty registers.
7. `kpp_update_state()` (in `components/hex_motion_limits/kpp_system.c`)
	* Updates state estimation from the original (pre-limited) command stream.

Supporting Modules:
* `components/hex_robot_config/robot_config.*` centralizes geometry, calibration, servo driver selection, GPIO mappings, and stance parameters.
* `components/hex_controller_core/controller.*` encapsulates channel state and decode helpers.
* `components/hex_kinematics/leg.*` provides pure kinematic modeling (opaque handle + IK solver) decoupled from hardware.
* `components/hex_motion_limits/kpp_config.h` contains KPP runtime-limit/filter constants.

### Main Loop (`main.c`)
The `gait_framework_main()` task sets a fixed timestep `dt=0.01f`, gathers user input, advances scheduler, generates trajectories, computes IK, applies KPP motion limits, commands servos, and updates KPP state from original commands. Timing uses `esp_timer_get_time()` plus `vTaskDelay()` to maintain cadence while yielding to other tasks.

### Concurrency & Timing
* Currently a single high-level control loop task drives all locomotion logic.
* Controller UART reception runs in its own FreeRTOS task created by `controller_init()`; shared channel data is protected by a mutex.
* Future expansion could move heavy IK or trajectory computation to a dedicated high-priority task if needed.

## 5. Gait System
Implemented gait types (selectable via RC switch):
* Tripod (`GAIT_TRIPOD`): Alternating two groups of three legs. Provides fastest, most stable dynamic movement baseline.
* Ripple (`GAIT_RIPPLE`): Two legs swing at a time in three staggered windows (pairs determined by index % 3). Smoother COG shift.
* Wave (`GAIT_WAVE`): Single-leg swing progression for maximum static stability at lower speed.

Inspiration / References:
* Elements of phase grouping, stability considerations, and prospective optimization directions are informed by the research article: Efficient gait generation and evaluation for hexapod robots (2024) – https://cjme.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s10033-024-01000-0. The current implementation is a simplified, real‑time friendly subset and will evolve toward more quantitative energy/stability metrics.

Scheduler Logic:
* Maintains a normalized phase; frequency scaled by commanded forward velocity magnitude and a user step scaling knob.
* Determines each leg’s support/swing state, which the trajectory generator uses to choose stance vs swing profile.

Trajectory Highlights:
* Step length modulated by speed magnitude × user step_scale.
* Clearance height boosted when `terrain_climb` is active.
* Lateral body shift and vertical body height mapped from normalized inputs to meter ranges (configurable constants inside `swing_trajectory_init`).
* Uses proportion S of the phase cycle for swing (0<S<1) depending on gait (Tripod=0.5, Ripple≈0.33, Wave≈0.1).

## 6. Servo Control Strategy (18 PWM on ESP32)
Classic ESP32 has limited MCPWM operator capacity. This design:
* Reuses MCPWM timers/operators across channels (group pooling) to produce up to 12 channels.
* Assigns remaining joints to LEDC (50 Hz, 15-bit resolution) achieving additional PWM outputs.
* Calibration struct `joint_calib_t` defines per-joint direction (`invert_sign`), angle limits, and PWM µs mapping (default 500–2500 µs range, neutral 1500 µs).
* Lazy initialization ensures only needed peripherals are configured.

## 7. Development Environment
* IDE: Visual Studio Code with the official ESP‑IDF extension / environment.
* Build System: CMake generated by ESP‑IDF; project root contains `CMakeLists.txt` and `main/CMakeLists.txt`.
* Typical workflow:
  1. Configure target and flash settings in ESP‑IDF extension.
  2. Build (`idf.py build`) and flash (`idf.py flash`).
  3. Monitor logs (`idf.py monitor`) for control loop timing, servo init, and controller connection messages.

## 7.1 Python Integration Tests

The repository includes host-side pytest integration tests for runtime command validation.

Install test dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r test/requirements.txt
```

Run general listing tests:

```bash
python -m pytest -q test/test_config_general_listing.py
```

If you see warnings like `PytestExperimentalApiWarning: record_xml_attribute is an experimental feature`, the `pytest-embedded` plugin is being auto-loaded in this environment. For host-side integration tests in `test/`, run pytest with that plugin disabled:

```bash
python -m pytest -q -p no:embedded test/test_config_general_listing.py
```

Notes:
* These tests are intended for Windows hosts and use `winwifi` to reuse current `HEXABOT_xxx` Wi-Fi or connect to the first discovered matching network.
* Override target endpoint if needed with environment variables: `HEXABOT_IP` and `HEXABOT_PORT`.

## 8. Visualization & Simulation
Complementary project for iterating on gait algorithms without hardware:
https://github.com/pgrudzien12/hexapod-visualizer

This external visualizer helps refine trajectory shapes, gait transitions, and future whole‑body control strategies before deployment on the physical robot.

## 9. Power & Safety Considerations
* Separate UBEC for logic prevents voltage sag from high servo load causing MCU resets.
* Distributing leg pairs across independent 20A UBECs reduces peak current concentration and wiring heating.
* RC arm/disarm switch (`enable` flag) prevents unintended motion during setup; when disabled, scheduler freezes and all legs remain in support state.
* Future: add soft-start ramp and watchdog to detect IK failures / out-of-reach foot targets.

## 10. Planned / Future Work
Short-term:
* Refine inverse kinematics limits and add reachability checks with graceful fallback per leg.
* Parameterize trajectory scaling (y range, height limits) via runtime configuration.

Mid-term:
* Modular controller input abstraction (initial implementation complete: FlySky iBUS driver + pluggable architecture for WiFi / BT).
* Web-based configuration interface (inspired by Betaflight) for tuning: servo calibration, gait parameters, stance geometry, safety thresholds.
* Persistent storage (NVS) for robot configuration instead of static initialization.
* Enhanced turning support: integrate yaw rate (`wz`) into per-leg lateral/forward offsets.

Long-term / Stretch:
* Add NVIDIA Jetson companion computer with stereoscopic depth camera for vision, terrain classification, and autonomous navigation (high-level planner sends velocity/pose commands to ESP32 locomotion layer).
* Terrain-adaptive foot placement (reactive height and lateral adjustment based on sensed surface). 
* State estimation fusing IMU and leg odometry.
* Energy-efficient gait optimization layer (multi-objective: power consumption vs stability vs speed), extending ideas from the referenced 2024 hexapod gait research to adapt duty factor and phase offsets on-the-fly.

4. Build & flash.
5. Power servos from their UBECs only after confirming logic supply is stable.

## 13. Notes on Customization
* Adjust leg geometry: change lengths in `leg_geometry_t` initialization before calling `leg_configure()`.
* Tune servo mappings: update `joint_calib_t` ranges & neutral offsets in `robot_config_init_default()`.
* Tune KPP limits/filters in `components/hex_motion_limits/kpp_config.h`.
* Add new gait: extend `gait_type_t`, expand switch in `gait_scheduler_update()` and adapt `swing_trajectory_generate()` for phase offset logic.

### Controller Abstraction & Future Runtime Swapping

The controller layer now provides a driver abstraction. Key points:

* Each driver spins a FreeRTOS task ingesting raw input (UART, TCP socket, Bluetooth) then updates a shared signed channel array (32 × int16_t, range -32768..32767) guarded by a mutex.
* Existing APIs `controller_get_channels()` and `controller_decode()` remain stable; locomotion stack is transport‑agnostic.
* Failsafe injects neutral (zero) channels when a driver times out or disconnects.
* Current driver: FlySky iBUS over UART (default) – its 1000..2000 values are rescaled into full signed range for first 14 slots; remaining slots zero.
* WiFi TCP driver (added): versioned binary frame (74 bytes) with sync (AA55), header, 32 signed channels, CRC16.
	* Detailed spec: see [docs/WIFI_TCP_PROTOCOL.md](docs/WIFI_TCP_PROTOCOL.md).
	* Current network mode: AP-only for simplicity (see [docs/WIFI_NETWORK_MODES.md](docs/WIFI_NETWORK_MODES.md) for evolution plan to AP+STA).
	* AP SSID generation supports fixed, MAC-suffix, or random-suffix modes (default = MAC suffix, e.g. `HEXAPOD_AP_3AF2B7`).
* Opaque driver configuration: `controller_config_t` holds a `driver_cfg` pointer + size (e.g. `controller_flysky_ibus_cfg_t`). This keeps core lean while enabling WiFi / BT specific parameters. Memory ownership is with caller.
* Developer guide for writing new drivers: see [docs/CONTROLLER_DRIVERS.md](docs/CONTROLLER_DRIVERS.md).
* (Early draft WiFi packet format removed; see [docs/WIFI_TCP_PROTOCOL.md](docs/WIFI_TCP_PROTOCOL.md) for the authoritative current definition.)

Runtime selection (future): store selected driver + params (e.g. WiFi port, BT service UUID) in NVS, applied at boot so firmware can remain static while changing control sources from the portal.
